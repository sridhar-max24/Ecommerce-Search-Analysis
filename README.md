**# E-Commerce Search Relevance & Filter Analysis: Amazon vs. Walmart**  

## **Introduction**
In the world of e-commerce, search relevance plays a critical role in providing users with the most accurate and useful results. A well-optimized search engine helps customers find products quickly and efficiently, enhancing user experience and increasing sales. This study explores the effectiveness of search results and filters on popular e-commerce platforms, **Amazon** and **Walmart**, to understand how well they cater to user intent.

## **Case Study: Search & Filtering on Amazon & Walmart**
To evaluate search relevance and filtering efficiency, we analyzed two product searches on both platforms:

### **1. Search: "Wireless Headphones"**
#### **Observations:**
- **Amazon:** The top results included well-known brands (Sony, JBL, Bose), but the first row had **sponsored listings** rather than organic search results.
- **Walmart:** No sponsored products appeared; all search results were relevant and well-organized.
- **Filters:**
  - Amazon‚Äôs filter options included **brand, price, ratings, and features** (e.g., noise cancellation), but some unrelated products (wireless speakers) still appeared.
  - Walmart‚Äôs filters worked accurately, showing only the selected brands and price range.

### **2. Search: "Smartwatches under $100"**
#### **Observations:**
- **Amazon:** Mixed product layout; some items appeared in rows, others in columns, making navigation less uniform.
- **Walmart:** Clean UI, proper product alignment, and no ads.
- **Filters:**
  - Amazon applied filters correctly, but still displayed some unrelated items.
  - Walmart applied filters accurately, giving a smoother and more relevant search experience.

## **Findings & Suggested Improvements**
### **1. Improve Search Ranking Algorithms**
- **Issue:** Amazon prioritizes sponsored ads, sometimes over organic search relevance.
- **Solution:** Adjust AI algorithms to balance sponsored content with genuine search relevance.

### **2. Enhance UI Consistency**
- **Issue:** Amazon‚Äôs product display varies between row and column layouts.
- **Solution:** Standardize layout structure for better user experience.

### **3. Optimize Filtering Logic**
- **Issue:** Amazon sometimes includes unrelated products even after filtering.
- **Solution:** Improve filtering accuracy to ensure all displayed products match the selected criteria.

## **Conclusion: Which Platform is Better?**
Based on our analysis, **Walmart provides a better overall shopping experience** due to its **lack of sponsored ads, clean UI, and accurate filtering system**. While Amazon offers strong filtering options, it sometimes displays **irrelevant products** and has a **less consistent layout**, making navigation slightly harder. **Both platforms deliver correct search results after filtering,** but Walmart‚Äôs structured experience makes it the better choice for search relevance and ease of use.
